## The Linux Command Line - A Complete Introduction - William Shotts, 2nd Edition

This .md file contains my notes wonderful book above. I have no intention to summarize everything covered in the book - main purpose of this file is to prepare a somehow extended appendix only covering the points that are most interesting to me. Also this will help me to refresh my mind if required and just to help me and hopefully others to find out where to find what. 

Have a strong hope to complete reading the book and not to hesitate to do exercises to get most from the book.
