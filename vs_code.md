## VS Code Keyboard shortcuts (Replace Ctrl with cmd for MAC)

This repository is Readme file only to summarize some basic VS Code Editor keyboard shortcuts. With appreciation of the power that comes with minimizing mouse usage, tried to summarize 
some basic shortcuts that can be used with vs code. 

**Alt + 1,2,3** -> will switch between tabs

**Ctrl + p** -> Quick search file name to open (Similar to Ctrl + T in MS Visual Studio)

**Ctrl + w** -> Close a tab

**Ctrl + k + w** -> Close all tabs 
Note: When closing the tabs - prompt will be issued for any unsaved changes. Press tab to navigate between the options. 

**Ctrl + b** -> Hide / unhide the sidebar (EXPLORER)

**Ctrl + "-/+"** -> Zoom In / Out. Note that Ctrl + = would also zoom in (no need to press shift)

**Ctrl + \ **-> Add a new column to the view. After this Ctrl + 1,2,3.. will toggle between the columns. It's possible to go to each column and open multiple tabs using any commands (like Ctrl + p etc.)
**Note:** I found only by closing all tabs in a column it's possible to close the column. Probably there's a shortcut that I couldn't find.
**Note:** If same file opened in multiple columns, modifying the file in a column, will modify in all. ***

**Ctrl + ` ** -> Hide/Unhide the terminal. Note that the tilda operator is generally located on the upper left corner of the keyboard. 

**Ctrl + Left/Right Arrow buttons** -> Navigate thru "words" quickly, this just jumps over the words

**Ctrl + Shift + Left/Right Arrow buttons** -> Similar to above, but with selection

**Ctrl + X (without any selection)** -> Cut line

**Ctrl + C (without any selection)** -> Copy line

**Ctrl + V (without any selection)** -> Paste line

**Ctrl + /** -> Comment/uncomment line (without selection)
**Note:** It's possible to select multiple lines and similarly comment/uncomment. 

**Ctrl + h** -> Find and replace (Enter -> will change one by one, Ctrl + Alt + Enter to replace all)

**Ctrl + d** -> To select same words. Note pressing multiple times will select more items. Then type for all. 

**Alt + Up/Down Arrow buttons** -> Will move the line up or down (works with selected multiple lines, if not selected applied to a single line)

**Ctrl + Shift + o** -> To search for variable/function etc. names

**Ctrl + g** -> type line number to go there (My Favorite Shortcut)
